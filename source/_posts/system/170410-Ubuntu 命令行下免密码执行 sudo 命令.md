The approach to solve your problem is to put your user in sudoers file.

Open terminal window and type:
``` bash
sudo visudo
```
In the bottom of the file, type the follow:
```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Note:
This only applies, to sudo command in terminal window. For example, when you try to install a package in software center, you will be prompted to insert your password
